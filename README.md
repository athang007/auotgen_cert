autogen cerificates using matlab

The main code is available on the internet.  I only adjust a bit to align texts and font.
To align the text, I use photoshop to determine the coordinaate [x,y] of the anchor point, then set the anchor point to center.
U can use any fonts that's available in your computer or leave the font name blank, matlab gonna tell which font you can use.
